# Progress Log

## Step 1: Project Structure and Base Configuration (Completed)
- Verified that the project uses a modern Next.js 14 (App Router) structure with appropriate folders (`app`, `components`, `hooks`, `mocks`, `providers`, `test`, `utils`).
- Confirmed Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui are configured and working.
- Checked that environment variables for Supabase are referenced and ready to be loaded.
- Confirmed the base layout and page components render correctly and are styled.
- Ran build and dev scripts to ensure the app builds and runs without errors.
- Successfully loaded the home page and registered a user via the authentication flow.

## Step 2: Authentication System (Completed)
- Implemented `SupabaseAuthProvider` in `src/providers/SupabaseAuthProvider.tsx` to provide user, session, and role context via React Context API.
- Marked the provider as a Client Component for compatibility with React hooks.
- Wrapped the app in `SupabaseAuthProvider` in `src/app/layout.tsx` for global access to authentication state.
- Successfully tested login with an existing user and reached the home page.

## Step 3: Navigation and Base Layout (Completed)
- Implemented a Sidebar as a pure client component with a hardcoded role and local menu config to ensure reliable rendering.
- Sidebar now displays the correct menu for the 'administrator' role and renders as expected.
- Breadcrumb navigation and responsive layout are present in the base layout.
- This approach allows further UI and feature development while authentication is revisited incrementally.

## Step 4: Client List Page (Mostly Complete)
- Client list page is implemented and fetches data from Supabase.
- UI is present and styled.
- **Next:** Add filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## Step 5: Client Detail Views (In Progress)
- Client detail page shows all client info.
- Client uploads (document repository) is fully functional with upload, download, delete, and RLS.
- **Next:** Add client history (past events), and polish edit client functionality.
